# PDF to Excel Form Automation (Co-op Project Example)
## This repository showcases a Python script I developed during my co-op, which reads data from PDF files and inserts it into a structured Excel form. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to automate real-world data entry tasks using Python.

# Project Highlights
## - **Reads PDF files**  (tables or text)
## - **Extracts relevant data** using Python libraries (`pdfplumber`, `PyPDF2`, or `tabula-py`)
## - **Inserts data into Excel** using `openpyxl` or `pandas`
## - **Automates repetitive manual tasks** for improved efficiency

# How It Works
## 1. **Extracts data** from the specified PDF file.
## 2. **Processes and cleans** the data as needed.
## 3. **Writes the data** into a pre-defined Excel template or form.
